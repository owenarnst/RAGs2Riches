Their strategy is built on four sustainable competitive\n","advantages: a strong foundation of manufacturing and technology, a broad portfolio of analog and\n","embedded processing products, a reach of market channels, and diversity and longevity of products,\n","markets, and customer positions.  In 2021, TI reported revenue of $18.34 billion, an increase of 27%\n","from 2020, driven mainly by higher revenue from Analog and Embedded Processing products.

TI returned $4.41 billion to shareholders\n","through dividends and stock repurchases, with dividends accounting for 62% of free cash flow.  The\n","MD&A also discusses TI's liquidity and capital resources, including their primary source of\n","liquidity, cash flow from operations, and access to debt markets. The company had $9.74 billion in\n","total cash and cash equivalents plus short-term investments at the end of 2021, with a variable rate\n","revolving credit facility that was undrawn.
